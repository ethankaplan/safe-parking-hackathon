## Redefined Problem Statement:  

SPLA operators currently do not have an easy method to provide information about resources to transitionally homeless people. 

How might we provide all the resources together so that the SPLA operators, and homeless people alike, can easily search for resources near them?

## User Stories: 
As an SPLA operator, (or a transitional homeless person), I want to search for resources within a location so that I can help homeless people find resources close to their current location. 

As an SPLA operator, (or a transitional homeless person), I want to filter for specific resources by distance so that I can tell people where they can get things like food, laundry facilities, or a shower near them.  

As an SPLA operator, I want to be able to add and edit resources so that I have autonomy in keeping the database can stay current.  

As someone facing homelessness, I want to be able to see all the resources near me so I know where and when I can get a shower, food etc. 

As someone facing homelessness, I want to be able to filter for specific resources so I only see the things I need the most urgently. 

As someone facing homelessness, I want to see the phone number, address, and website information of the resources near me so I have immediate information about how and when I can access all of my survival needs.  

As an SPLA operator, I want to create an account in order to add or edit resources, so the SPLA has some control over all the information being submitted. (Versus giving homeless folks access to add/edit resources.)
